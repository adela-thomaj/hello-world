     <p>VITAMIN A, VITAMIN B6, VITAMIN B12, VITAMIN D, VITAMIN F, VITAMIN K2, AMINO ACIDS (CREATINE, CARNITINE, CARNOSINE, TAURINE), Heme iron, CoQ10, CLA. </p>
<h2>Let's give a brief explanation for each one of the above mentioned vitamins, amino acids, Heme iron, CoQ10 and CLA!</h2>
<h3>VITAMIN A</h3>
     <p>Vitamin A, also known as retinol, has several important functions.
        These include:
        -helping your body's natural defence against illness and infection (the immune system) work properly
        -helping vision in dim light
        -keeping skin and the lining of some parts of the body, such as the nose, healthy
     <br>
         Good sources of vitamin A (retinol) include:
         -cheese
         -eggs
         -oily fish
         -homemade butter
         -milk and yoghurt
     </p>
<h3>VITAMIN B6</h3>
     <p>Vitamin B6, also known as pyridoxine, helps:
        -the body to use and store energy from protein and carbohydrates in food
        -the body form haemoglobin, the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body
     <br>
        Good sources of vitamin B6
        -pork
        -poultry, such as chicken or turkey
        -fish
        -milk
     </p>
<h3>VITAMIN B12</h3>
     <p>Do you get enough vitamin B12? You'll want to make sure that you do, in order to stay healthy.
         Vitamin B12 does a lot of things for your body. It helps make your DNA and your red blood cells, for example.
         Since your body doesn't make vitamin B12, you have to get it from animal-based foods or from supplements. And you should do that on a regular basis, because your body doesn't store vitamin B12 for a long time.
     <br>
        Good sources of vitamin B12:
        -meat
        -fish
        -milk
        -cheese
        -eggs
     </p>
<h3>VITAMIN D</h3>
     <p>Vitamin D helps regulate the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body.
        These nutrients are needed to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy.
        A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone deformities such as rickets in children, and bone pain caused by a condition called osteomalacia in adults.
     <br>
        Good sources of vitamin D:
        -oily fish – such as salmon, sardines, herring and mackerel
        -red meat
        -liver
        -egg yolks
     </p>
<h3>VITAMIN F</h3>
     <p>Rather, vitamin F is a term for two fats — alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA). They are essential for regular body functions, including aspects of brain and heart health.
     <br>
        Good sources of vitamin F:
        -Meat
        -Fish 
        -Homemade Oils
     </p>
<h3>VITAMIN K2</h3>
     <p>Vitamin K2 (menaquinone): It contributes to skin health and bone metabolism, promotes proper brain function and prevents heart-related diseases. Furthermore, vitamin K2 is important in the body's use of calcium to help build bones and to inhibit blood vessel calcification. Vitamin K2 is found in animal foods and preserved foods.
     <br>
     Good sources of vitamin K2:
     -dairy products, especially hard cheeses
     -liver and other organ meats
     -beef
     -pork
     -egg yolks
     -chicken
     -fatty fish, such as salmon
     </p>
<h3>AMINO ACIDS (CREATINE, CARNITINE, CARNOSINE, TAURINE)</h3>
     <p>Amino acids, often referred to as the building blocks of proteins, are compounds that play many critical roles in your body. They're needed for vital processes like the building of proteins and synthesis of hormones and neurotransmitters.
     <br>
     Good sources of Amino Acids :
     -Eggs are an excellent source of protein, containing all of the essential amino acids. 
     -dairy products, especially hard cheeses
     -liver and other organ meats
     -beef
     -pork
     -chicken
     -fish
     </p>
<h3>Heme-iron</h3>
     <p>Iron helps form the hemoglobin that carries oxygen around the body from the lungs.
        Heme iron, which is better absorbed by the body, is mostly found in meat, poultry and fish.
     <br>
        Good sources of Heme-iron :
        -Oysters, clams, mussels
        -Beef or chicken liver
        -Organ meats
        -Canned sardines
        -Beef
        -Poultry
        -Canned light tuna
     </p>
<h3>Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)</h3>
     <p>CoQ10 has been shown to help improve heart health and blood sugar regulation, assist in the prevention and treatment of cancer and reduce the frequency of migraines.
        It could also reduce the oxidative damage that leads to muscle fatigue, skin damage and brain and lung diseases.
     <br>
        Good sources of CoQ10:
        -Organ meats: Heart, liver and kidney.
        -Some muscle meats: Pork, beef and chicken.
        -Fatty fish: Trout, herring, mackerel and sardine.
        -Fruit: Oranges and strawberries.
     </p>
<h3>CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid)</h3>
     <p>The main dietary sources of CLA are the meat and milk of ruminants, such as cows, goats and sheep.
        The total amounts of CLA in these foods varies greatly depending on what the animals ate
     <br>
        Good sources of CLA:
        many animal products, like milk, beef, and other meat. Grass-fed beef may have higher levels of CLA than grain-fed beef. It's also in sunflower and safflower oil. Cooking food may increase levels of CLA.
